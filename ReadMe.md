## Synopsis
This is a modular login & registration project built using Entity ORM, intended to be reused for any future projects requiring user account verification. Built using C# within the ASP.NET Core framework.

## Direct Goals
1. Create a universal login & registration page for future projects.
2. Practicing object relational mapping with Entity.
3. Utilize partials to display multiple bound models on a single html page.
4. Developing my skills in C# and ASP.NET Core.

## Features
- Captures user data through session and displays it after succesful login/registration.
- Secures sensitive user information using hashing.
- Connects to MySQL database via Entity ORM.
- Used Twitter Bootstrap for basic styling.
- Secure connection strings using dependency injection.
